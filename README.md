# Allergy-Scanner
This is an Android Project created for my Third year Mobile Computing assignment at the University of Lincoln. 
The application works by taking the users allergys which they set on first opening of the app.
The user can then scan product barcodes, and using a product API, the app will alert the user if any of their allergens are present in the product.
